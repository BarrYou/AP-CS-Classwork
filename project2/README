This is an adventure game in which player can kill monsters, getting weapons, gold, and XP from them. Player can try to change the monsters into his pets that help him kill more monsters or tame more. The abilities of the player and the pets can be improved by improving their level with XP. The combat mode is turn-based, comparing the attack, defense and HP each round. There will also be the consideration of luckiness because some attacks can be critical strike. The player can choose either to fight with a monster or to flee when he meet with one. He can fight with low level monsters for practising and improving the abilities. Player can use gold to buy stuff in the shop system. All of the choices and instructions are in the Console in Eclipse.
